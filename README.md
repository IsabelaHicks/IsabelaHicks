### What Year of Study am I in and what is my Major?
>I am currently enrolled in my **4th** year at *Dalhousie University* and am majoring in **Psychology**.



### Why did I enroll into PSYO 3505 (i.e. Neural Data Science)?
>I enrolled into **PSYO 3505** originally because this course goes towards getting my certificate in *Neurotechnology Innovation,* however my main reason for choosing this course is that I never have learned a coding language before. I enjoyed when reading the course description for this class that I would get the opportunity to learn how scientific programming in *Python* is used in lab scenarios and in the real world, which I believe is an asset to have after graduating with my degree in **Psychology**.

### What got me interested in Psychology?
>Ever since I was little I've always been more of an observant person and was interested in the thoughts and motivations of people. However, I never thought of majoring in **Psychology** until halfway through my second year as a **Chemistry** major.
- I found that I only liked a niche part of **Chemistry** whereas I enjoyed learning many areas of **Psychology**. I discovered as well that my major was not important in terms of my future career plans, thus majoring in **Psychology** is a better fit for me overall. 



### What are my career plans after graduating with my bachelors degree in Psychology?
>My career plans after graduation is to be accepted into a masters program for becoming a *Physician Assistant (PA)* and to specialize in *Dermatology*. 
>> I want to specialize in *Dermatology* specifically because I enjoy the organic chemistry side of skincare and because I struggled with acne growing up. Helping people feel more confident in their skin (and their nails and hair) is something that I am very passionate about!!
