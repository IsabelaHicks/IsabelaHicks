### What Year of Study am I in and what is my Major?
>I am currently enrolled in my **4th** year at *Dalhousie University* and am majoring in **Psychology**.

### Why did I enroll into PSYO 3505 (i.e. Neural Data Science)?
>I enrolled into **PSYO 3505** originally because this course goes towards getting my certificate in *Neurotechnology Innovation,* however my main reason for choosing this course is that I never have learned a coding language before. I enjoyed when reading the course description for this class that I would get the opportunity to learn how scientific programming in *Python* is used in lab scenarios and in the real world, which I beleive is an asset to have after graduating with my degree in **Psychology**.

### What got me interested in Psychology?
>Ever since I was little I've always been more of an observant person and was interested in the thoughts and motivations of people. However, I never thought of majoring in **Psychology** until halfway through my second year as a **Chemistry** major.
- I found that I only liked a niche part of **Chemistry** in comparison to **Psychology**, thus this was a better fit with my interests and goals for the future.
